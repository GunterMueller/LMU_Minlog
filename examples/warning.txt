        WARNING: detected a difference in the output
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The offending filename is printed below (followed by the current directory)
There might be two reasons for this:

 1.) Minlog has a new feature and therefore gives new answers. In this case
     change the corresponding .save file.
 2.) A new bug was introduced to the minlog system. Fix it!

Read the differences carefully before deciding whether 1 or 2 is the case.
You might also whish to read the .out file containing all of minlog's output.
